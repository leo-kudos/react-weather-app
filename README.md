# React Weather App
My weather app built from scrach especially to Thinkific

## Goals
- Use the OpenWeatherMap 5 day weather forecast API to retrieve and display the current 5-day weather forecast for a city (ex. Vancouver): http://openweathermap.org/forecast5
- Create a responsive version
- Add a feature to explore the weather information in other cities
- Deploy your assignment somewhere and include the link in your README so we can try it out
